            <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
            <p>
              Sometimes I
              <i>feel</i>
              that my
              <i>body</i>
              is an obstruction.
            </p>

            <p>
              Therefore, I have to state, "I am
              <i>not</i>
              my body". The body of work and thought is the true body of mine,
              not the one which fails to wake up on time every morning. “I am
              not my physical body” seems to be an absurd statement, but only
              until there is a possibility to choose from multiple different
              modes of existence. The level of trust in technology, in a tech
              saturated environment of the first world, allows to speculate and
              to suggest that eventually and machine mind can merge to create a
              hybrid. The current human body has many limitations, so what if we
              were able to wire our brains to powerful and tireless computers?
              In that perspective, I do not want to be a human. No, by saying
              that I don’t mean that I want to stop living, to commit suicide.
              It is just a reflection on the bitter taste of losing to a
              machine. A machine which is so essential to me.
            </p>

            <p>What are the qualities in which it exceeds me?</p>

            <p>
              The quality I crave is the directness with which tasks are
              executed once defined. A machine may crash if a task requires too
              much of its power, but it won’t have doubts or procrastinate on
              the way from point A, when the assignment is given, to point B,
              when it is delivered.

                I am speaking of small-scale computation, mainly about the
                experience of a creative professional coexisting with her
                laptop. On a higher level, is the task of computation to deliver
                results or rather to open up opportunities?

              As an homage to “The Man-Machine” by Kraftwerk, I‘d call a
              hypothetical hybrid of me and a computer “The Woman-Machine”,
              simply because I am a woman, and also because the “robotic chants”
              make me want to dance. The Woman-Machine is intelligent (which is
              the quality of a human and a machine), outstandingly productive
              (more machine than me), and capable of effortless learning (think
              combination of machine learning and human curiosity). The
              Woman-Machine never has writer’s block. And I do.

              Besides writer's block, there is a deadline, when this thesis
              needs to be delivered.

                That particular deadline has passed, only to allow new ones to
                come, such as preparing a new version of the text. I am still
                struggling with all the aforementioned things.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>
              And it does not matter if I am desperate, exhausted, or losing my
              mind. This is the very moment when I attempt to become a machine:
              There are vast amounts of software and applications designed to
              improve my productivity, and I gladly let their interfaces to
              shape my behaviour.
            </p>

            <p>
              Interfaces are designed to guide people through the daily process
              of interaction with their devices, such as for planning and
              reminders, online purchases, or bills. Everything is administered
              by software. These programs communicate in a natural language,
              enabling the user to learn how to be understood by her device.
            </p>

            <p>Technology is becoming more and more user-friendly</p>

                Yet we are discovering more and more about the hunter-gatherer
                nature of algorithms ruling our social lives, where the position
                of a user is not the one of an individual agency but the one of
                a prey

              which means that intuitive interaction can create an illusion that
              the human and the computer are speaking the same language, which
              is, in fact, not true.

                The sentence is very naive itself, yet, I still would not remove
                it. This statement is totally serious and charged with meaning
                in any of the fictional universes where humans coexist with
                embodied machines, such as Westworld or Ex-machina.

            <p>
              In this kind of environment the difference between user experience
              and interpersonal relationship is not that obvious. The prospect
              of machines learning faster than humans and becoming
              super-intelligent raise even more questions about the definition
              of humanity and the ways in which humans will communicate.<sup

            <p>
              Coming back to the “The Woman-Machine”, will sex and gender still
              exist if there is no need for biological reproduction? Maybe the
              physical body will have no value in the future. Will there be any
              hospitals when organic parts can be replaced with machinery? In
              this techno-utopian or techno-dystopian scenario, I cannot imagine
              anyone preventing her physical body from dying. We will be losing
              our bodies just to be reborn, as a caterpillar abandons its body
              to start living as a butterfly.
            </p>

            <p>
              The illusion of likeness, facilitated by friendly and intuitive
              interfaces, makes artificial intelligence somehow expected to
              become sensitive, and yet to take over humans and dictate their
              behaviour. The assumption comes from the human expectation, driven
              by this illusion, that it has a similar desire to compete and
              conquer. But people already coexist with many AI implementations:
              from simple chatbots, “employed” as sales assistants or leaving
              spam comments to Google’s complex neural network algorithms which
              enable the search engines to “learn on their own”.

              While simple chatbots deploy specific forms of programmed

              simulate the complexity of the human brain. These networks process
              enormous amounts of data, recognize patterns, and adapt and apply
              their learning in a diverse range of tasks.

                Also it is a different division of labor? To train a chatbot

              comes from a Greek word organon, which literally means
              “instrument”. The living thing that can react to stimuli,
              reproduce, grow and maintain homeostasis. The Wikipedia article
              describes homeostasis as
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="quote"
                >“ ...the property of a system in which variables are regulated
                so that internal conditions remain stable and relatively
                constant. Examples of homeostasis include the regulation of
                temperature and the balance between acidity and alkalinity (pH).
                Human homeostasis is the process that maintains the stability of
                the human body's internal environment in response to changes in
                external conditions.”
                <sup>10</sup>
              </span>
            </p>

            <p>
              In other words, organisms are able to regulate their internal
              processes and to adjust to the environment. An organism maintains
              its bits and parts together and positions itself in space, being a
              <i>self-regulating design</i>. An organism can re-grow some of its
              parts. For example, the average person, an organism, loses
              somewhere in between 60 and 100 hairs a day, and 90% of all hairs
              on her head are in the stage of growth. The remaining 10 percent
              are in the stage of resting and about to fall.
            </p>

            <p>
              Speaking of homeostasis, devices have enclosures designed in a
              such a way that people can use them without breaking the
              mechanism. I may think that AI is not aware of its own enclosure
              and physical presence, but I barely know anything about the
              processes inside my own body. Although people are aware of having
              a body, they often face difficulties when describing what exactly
              they feel.
            </p>

            <p>
              According to Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy we are aware of
              “the position and movements of our limbs, of the contact of our
              clothes on our skin, of the muscle pain in our legs, of our
              feeling of thirst. It may be difficult to describe what we feel,
              but what we feel can be so intense that we are sometimes not able
              to think of anything else than our body”
              <sup>11</sup>.

              Machines are not organically constructed, but man-made. They are
              the products of human culture; so far they remain inside of it,
              and there is no “machine culture” yet. Also, there are no machines
              which are able to think exactly the way humans do, because the
              knowledge about the brain doesn’t give all the information,
              required to re-create these processes. In school, we are taught
              the basics of computation and languages, but the way the brain
              multiplies or subtracts or conjugates verbs remains unexplained.
            </p>

            <p>
              The machine can be reassembled, or if destroyed, replaced with
              another one. The production of a machine follows very strict
              guidelines, and the result is predictable. This is the opposite of
              organic nature, where the result varies. Genetically modified and
              edited organisms are the result of a human attempt to make
              organisms which fit certain expectations, and the difference
              between production of an Apple and production of an apple gets
              blurred.
            </p>

            <p>
              A machine has mechanical power, is built to perform particular
              tasks, and can be turned on and off. A human cannot be turned on
              and off entirely, only certain functions can be enabled or
              disabled. Modern medicine works towards the possibility to extend
              a human lifetime by making parts replaceable or growing new ones.
              The desire for eternal life has been clearly expressed by certain
              groups — from the believers in afterlife to the adepts of
              cryonics, who freeze their brain hoping that one day there can be
              a technology to revive it and give it a body.

              Google, in the meantime, does not only count on its machinery, but
              has established a biotech company. Calico
              <sup>12</sup>
              (California Life Company), founded in 2013, researches aging in
              order to enable people to lead longer and healthier lives.

              Certainly, technological progress has a lot to do with the fear of
              death, something which will inevitably happen to a wealthy
              first-world tech-optimist, as well as to anyone. As a living
              being, which has begun and will end and then decompose, a human
              has only one body and cannot (yet) transition to another one, only
              adjust the one she already owns. Decomposing organisms fertilize
              the growing ones, unlike the decomposing machines. Would the world
              be a better place if we could grow hard drives out of piles of
              dead floppy disks?

              In his book
              <i>Design as Art</i>
              Bruno Munari describes an orange as an industrial product. After
              explaining the structure and the content of an orange, he explains
              the purpose of the seed:
              <span class="quote">
                “...the sections generally contain a small seed from the same
                plant that produced the fruit. This is a small free gift offered
                by the firm to the client in case the latter wishes to start a
                production of these objects on his own account. We draw your
                attention to the fact while no economic loss is incurred in this
                gift, it gives rise to an important psychological bond between
                producer and consumer...”
                <sup>13</sup>

              Ironically, one of the most influential tech companies of our time
              carries a name of a fruit. Imagine Apple giving a seed of an
              IPhone to its customer?

              Back to the topic of intelligence, I will cite Steven Pinker’s
              book
              <i>How The Mind Works</i>:
              <span class="quote"
                >“Intelligence, then, is the ability to attain goals in the face
                of obstacles by means of decisions based on rational
                (truth-obeying) rules. The computer scientists Allen Newell and
                Herbert Simon fleshed this idea out further by noting that
                intelligence consists of specifying a goal, assessing the
                current situation to see how it differs from the goal, and
                applying a set of operations that reduce the difference. Perhaps
                reassuringly, by this definition human beings, not just aliens,
                are intelligent. We have desires, and we pursue them using
                beliefs, which, when all goes well, are at least approximately
                or probabilistically true. — intelligence is following the
                desire, but what does the AI follow?”
                <sup>14</sup>
              </span>
            </p>

            <p>
              Pinker notes that rational rules are described as truth-obeying.
              Machine intelligence is not meant to have doubts or to modify what
              “the truth” is. Serendipity, as a quality of the human thinking
              process, seems to be a limitation when the only criterion of
              comparison is efficiency. People are familiar with doubts and
              paradoxes, and intuition can lead to a new insight. But, being a
              human myself, I have no objectivity in defining whether the
              serendipitous detours and procrastination are not the part of a
              “truth-obeying” script running on the background<sup>15</sup>.
              Even more, as I evolve as a professional, I try to incorporate
              failures and hesitations into the process of aiming for
              hyperefficiency.
            </p>

            <p>
              Counting on the latest developments in machine learning, the fear
              of AI is the fear of machines having their own truth, which may
              not include the wellbeing of humanity.

              an abstract and broad topic required a lot of research and
              narrowing down to a sizable amount of knowledge. The problem was,
              that while writing about choices, selection methods, and filtering
              information, I...couldn’t decide what exactly I was writing about.
              A mechanism of making a single decision bothers and puzzles me so
              much because, as a designer, I am eager to search for an
              underlying pattern. But, with all the efforts I undertake, the
              pattern of a decision-making does not reveal itself.

              Graphic design works with vast amounts of information and partly
              consists of building structures, patterns and templates. During
              the three years I have been studying this discipline, I became
              fascinated with the ways designers work with
              <span class="added">content</span>
              <span class="removed">information</span>: organizing enormous
              amounts of data and creating complex schemes to sort, digest, and
              display it. Reducing information flows to a rather visual message
              requires a lot of rational thinking and reasoning. We are taught
              to create frameworks to fragment and make “the big thing”
              digestible, and there is so much beauty in processing intricate
              experiences into a single visual message.

                Writing it today, I would totally avoid using the word data

              As I am writing this text, the Pomodoro technique app is counting
              the time. I have my own planning, but the interface suggests, that
              to complete a task (which still need to defined) I need to have 10
              working sessions, 25 minutes each. Besides Pomodoro, a word count
              tool is keeping me on track of the few-thousand-words-thesis, a
              period tracker app shows that craving chocolate today is purely
              hormonal (so I should get some to be more productive in my
              writing) and I also track my activity, moves, and headaches. All
              of this for the sake of being more productive. Does being that
              informed help me make the right choice? No.

              Choosing is so complicated because the perfect decision is a
              product of balancing two extremities: making fast decisions
              without contemplation, and taking a very long time, and a lot of
              effort to make the best choice, which may lead to paralyzing
              indecisiveness.

            <p>
              The number of tools is escalating, so the search of balance for
              the sake of productivity helps spawn more and more apps in the
              already-saturated market. Instead of modifying my routine in order
              to enable it to structure itself, I get clogged in the labyrinth

            <p>
              Numerous planners and trackers remind me that I have serious tasks
              to complete and deciding and actually doing things becomes a
              burden. In Homo Ludens, Johan Huizinga writes that the highest
              concentration and dedication to the process happens if the process
              is wrapped in the structure of a game. Paradoxically, playing
              becomes the most serious process. The players are aware that they
              are playing a game, but instead of being weighed down by
              decision-making, they concentrate on an actual task.

              The beauty and elegance of a designed gameplay structure gives
              comfort and protects me from the uneasiness of the "real world”.
              What if “taking things seriously” in a solemn and adult way was
              just creating more obstacles? Maybe there should be a technique
              focused on removing the stressful part of making a decision? Maybe
              there should be a app for that?

              When looking at the existing iOS lifestyle applications, I see two
              extremes: There are so-called productivity apps, with goals to
              stimulate the user to achieve the desired result. There are
              planners, somewhere in between two extremes, because they are
              neutral towards the achievement of goals but also have a system of
              reminders to constantly keep on track with the status of the task.
              On the other hand, there are meditation and relaxation apps, meant
              to reduce anxiety, created by productivity tools and the constant
              buzz of reminders.
            </p>

            <p>
              Isn’t it bizarre that there are applications to manage one’s
              anxiety in the environment where reminders, timers, trackers and
              updates are inducing it at the very same time?

              By embracing the development of our operational systems and

              singularity. We trust our planners and apps to help us decide how
              to live. Will the machine help me to sort out my issues, will
              technology be my therapist? In a perfect world I can be human and

              The illusion of human to human interaction with the machine is
              called the ELIZA effect
              <sup>17</sup>. ELIZA is a computer program, written at MIT by
              Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966. It was designed to
              simulate a human-like conversation, based on processing user
              responses to scripts. The script DOCTOR was designed to simulate a
              conversation with a psychotherapist. It was one of the first
              chatterbots. Chatterbot (or bot) is a program whose purpose is to
              have a conversation with a human. The perspective of such software
              was that a computer would be able to pass a Turing test not by
              acquiring human qualities and intelligence, but by simply fooling
              the human.
            </p>

            <p>
              ELIZA is a milestone in the development of artificial intelligence
              because it was the first time that the goal of a programmer was to
              create an illusion of human-human interaction. Weizenbaum noticed
              that humans tend to bond emotionally with the machines, and unlike
              a car or a musical instrument, a computer affects the thinking and
              behaviour. In the 1976 book
              <i>Computer Power and Human Reason</i>
              he writes about people who experienced emotional bonding with the
              program he wrote:

                evidence that people were conversing with the computer as if it
                were a person who could be appropriately and usefully addressed
                in intimate terms. I knew of course that people form all sorts
                of emotional bonds to machines, for example, to musical
                instruments, motorcycles, and cars. And I knew from long
                experience that the strong emotional ties many programmers have
                to their computers are often formed after only short exposures
                to their machines. What I had not realized is that extremely
                short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could
                induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people. This
                insight led me to attach new importance to questions of the
                relationship between the individual and the computer, and hence
                to resolve to think about them.”

              with an artificial intelligence program named PARRY. Eliza was

              The machines we get attached to technically are still machines —

              bodily awareness. In order to understand why we rely on technology
              in our routine, we need to know and remember that the machine can

            <p>
              Biohacking is a movement that, among its other scopes, is
              dedicated to augmenting nature and the human body in particular by
              the means of technology. It aims to improve functionality and
              performance and also to provide people with more freedom in
              designing their own lives not by managing them, but by adjusting
              the body to the tasks it needs to perform. The data-driven
              lifestyle, first adopted by a few technology and computing
              enthusiasts, is getting more and more followers. Using hacker
              ethic,
              <sup>20</sup>
              biohackers consider the human body and mind a project which can be
              developed further.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hacker ethic is a term for the moral values and philosophy that
              are common in hacker culture. Practitioners of the hacker ethic
              acknowledge that sharing information and data responsibly is
              beneficial and helpful. Whilst the philosophy originated at the
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1950s–1960s, the term
              hacker ethic is attributed to journalist Steven Levy as described
              in his 1984 book titled
              <i>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</i>. The key points
              within this ethic are access, freedom of information, and
              improvement to quality of life.
              <sup>21</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              From their own point of view on the freedom of information ,
              biohackers claim access to biology/our bodies/data which can be
              received from self-tracking. The ideology stands for taking
              control of one’s health and mental condition from the hands of
              doctors and therapists. It promotes educating oneself about the
              way our bodies work and using intelligence, technology and logic
              to become an “advanced model” of an ordinary individual.
            </p>

            <p>
              Biohacking looks for the bits of source code to the human body: In
              its utopian vision the approach is perfect — one can program his
              or her body to function in a desired way. Maybe it can be upgraded
              to multifunctionality of a renaissance man (actually, I would
              write “a renaissance girl”, because I am female, but there is no
              such term. Girls didn’t run the world back then), but on the other
              hand an error or malware can lead to total destruction. Humans
              tend to err, so on a large scale biohacking seems like a possible
              doomsday scenario.
            </p>

            <p>
              On a small scale, biohacking is already being implemented in our
              everyday life. Are there biohackers among us?

              Take an example of a FitBit — an activity tracker in a form of a

              calories you burn, and it cheers the user when a milestone is
              achieved. And it looks just like any other bracelet.

              Technology becomes more subtle and seamlessly integrated into our

              to implant a board under your skin (as Tim Cannon did in 2013: he
              implanted a sensor, which gets the data on his body temperature
              and sends it to his smartphone). There are a lot of smartphone
              applications to measure and track your heartbeat, movements,

              Before Instagram, sharing an embodied vision of the world through
              images was an artistic method: In 2007 a performance artist
              Stelarc grew an ear-shaped tissue out of his own stem cells, and
              implanted it in his arm.
              <i>Ear on Arm</i>
              <sup>24</sup>
              project’s goal was not only to grow an ear which “hears” the same
              sounds as two original ears, but also makes the third ear to
              transmit these sounds. To share his ear with others, Stelarc had
              undergone two surgeries with risks and complications.

              It is very different from sharing a picture of food on social
              networks. But thinking only of the final purpose, the differences
              seem to disappear. Without involvement in the culture of body
              modification, we grow apps to transmit bits of the world, as seen
              through our eyes. Take Instagram as an extension of our eyes and
              ears, encapsulating the momentum and stirring the desire to share
              and to rent our eyes and ears to others, and to give the
              geographical coordinates to which our bodies have been.

              Non-invasive self-tracking and monitoring devices such as Fitbit

              First worn by punks, they were brought into fashion and almost
              dissociated with their rebellious roots. Biohacking goes from the

              Constantly monitoring activities and behaviours, such as
              exercising, sleeping, eating, walking, or using transport, is
              called lifelogging. It aims to summarize the data one’s body
              produces in order to give the human an objective image of herself.
              There is also a movement, called Quantified Self, which promotes
              self-knowledge through numbers and holds meetings and conferences
              on self-tracking and improving oneself using data. Essentially,
              every smartphone owner is equipped for it: There is a camera to
              make documentations, and GPS to track movements and coordinates.
              It is possible to measure and keep track of one’s heartbeat using
              a flash from the camera. Also, there are numerous apps for
              tracking cycles and mental conditions, and diary-like apps.
              Additionally, social media apps enable sharing. Lifelogging is
              gathering the data for personal use and lifestreaming is aimed to
              share this data. A smartphone can work for both.

              Chris Dancy calls himself “a mindful cyborg”. An article on

                >“45-year-old Chris Dancy is known as the most connected man in
                the world. He has between 300 and 700 systems running at any
                given time, systems that capture real-time data about his life.
                His wrists are covered with a variety of wearable technology,
                including the fitness wristband tracker Fitbit and the Pebble
                smartwatch. He weighs himself on the Aria Wifi scale, uses
                smartphone controlled Hue lighting at home and sleeps on a
                Beddit mattress cover to track his sleep.” As told in this
                interview, Chris does that to stay healthy. "I've lost 100
                pounds and learned to meditate," he says. "I'm much more aware
                of how I respond to life and take steps to adjust to my
                environment. I've also formed better habits thanks to the
                feedback I'm getting."

              His statement is quite paradoxical in itself — he claims that the
              feedback he gets from the devices he’s wearing makes him a better
              human. He is more aware of his functionality and better integrated
              in the environment. In this case, is it his own intention to do
              the things he does, or is he a co-creation of himself and his
              wearables? From the point of view of a lifelogger our data is
              mastering us, but on our own conditions.

              This story is so remarkable because it tells us about a man who
              deployed
              <i>between 300 and 700 systems</i>
              to simply lose weight. If he wasn’t such a tech-enthusiast, he
              would probably take another route. Thinking about all the
              obstructions to a healthy lifestyle, it is obvious that
              maintaining one is difficult. Building a career, eating well,
              sleeping enough and valuing your emotional well being
              simultaneously requires discipline. So of course the demand for
              machine control and automation of these processes seems very
              logical. It promises the ease of living which is so hard to
              achieve.

            <p>
              But is lifelogging a solution or a gimmick, barely describing real
              problems? In
              <i>Cyborg manifesto</i>
              Donna Haraway, explains that we are all indeed cyborgs, not by our
              own design, but, actually...by birth. Being born into the
              environment where all technology aims to improve the performance
              of a human body makes her a product of this environment. In her
              interview to Wired magazine she communicates the idea by using the
              example of sports footwear:
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="quote">
                "Think about the technology of sports footwear," she says.
                "Before the Civil War, right and left feet weren't even
                differentiated in shoe manufacture. Now we have a shoe for every
                activity." Winning the Olympics in the cyborg era isn't just
                about running fast. It's about "the interaction of medicine,
                diet, training practices, clothing and equipment manufacture,
                visualization and timekeeping." When the furor about the
                cyborgization of athletes through performance-enhancing drugs
                reached fever pitch last summer, Haraway could hardly see what
                the fuss was about. Drugs or no drugs, the training and
                technology make every Olympian a node in an international
                technocultural network just as "artificial" as sprinter Ben
                Johnson at his steroid peak.”<sup>26</sup>

              Do I consider myself a lifelogger? I would say so. If not a
              lifelogger, definitely a cyborg. Everyone who uses digital
              technology produces some amount of data without even realizing it,
              but I do intentionally turn my body’s activity into digits. I want
              to achieve better performance, but also constantly question my
              relationship with tech and my own data. Self-tracking does not
              always help to discover the core of the problem.
            </p>

            <p>
              To return to the idea of high-performance cyborgs, as the current
              peak of our co-existence with machines, I must confess that the
              reason why I want to become a machine is to increase own changes
              of getting employed.

                I failed to get employed after graduating my BA in 2016. I am
                still unemployed. Currently I work as a freelancer while
                obtaining an MA in Design from the Sandberg Institute in
                Amsterdam. What I meant in 2016 is that I want to outperform
                other candidates to score a full time contract. I am aware that
                becoming a machine is an easy way out of removing socio cultural
                limitations to my employment, such as the citizenship and
                gender. But what about the quality of my work? It is absolutely
                possible to work without weekends, while merging your brain with
                a computer remains conceptual. Really, this comment is the place
                to shout at my 2016 self for being naive and unwilling to look
                into what exactly renders me unemployable. What I also mean is
                that as a human I am easily discouraged and am capable of
                feeling upset after receiving a rejection etc. At the moment I
                am much closer to a mechanised performance – I write
                applications without having any expectation of the outcome (yet
                still fully passionate about everything I write about) and am
                able to continue working on other things immediately after my
                application gets rejected. I also experience less joy, because I
                stopped associating an invitation to an interview with a
                possibility of receiving a job offer, but that doesn’t matter
                much.

              A poetic performance by Erica Scourti illustrates this duality
              very well: an artist uses self-tracking and productivity
              applications in her practice. For her performance during the
              <i>Did you feel it?</i>
              symposium in Eindhoven, she used an application called Spritz to
              read her own poem on stage. Spritz is an application designed to
              improve the speed of reading. Its slogan is “save time, increase
              focus and have fun.” After uploading the text and selecting the
              speed in words per minute, the app starts to spit out the words in
              a selected speed and you only have to read what you see on the
              screen. This is an explanation of the science behind it from the
              official webpage:
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="quote">
                Traditional reading involves publishing text in lines and moving
                your eyes sequentially from word to word. For each word, the eye
                seeks a certain point within the word, which we call the
                “Optimal Recognition Point” or ORP. After your eyes find the
                ORP, your brain starts to process the meaning of the word that
                you’re viewing. With each new word, your eyes move, called a
                “saccade”, and then your eyes seek out the ORP for that word.
                Once the ORP is found, processing the word for meaning and
                context occurs and your eyes move to the next word. When your
                eyes encounter punctuation within and between sentences, your
                brain is prompted to assemble all of the words that you have
                read and processes them into a coherent thought.”

              Starting with a hundred words per minute, Erica kept gradually
              increasing the speed up to seven hundred words per minute, and at
              that certain moment she could not keep it up with her own text.
              She was reading it out loud on stage, and at the end of her
              performance, she ran out of breath, trying to keep up with the
              rhythm that the app was dictating.

              Erica performed her piece on stage in front of an audience, but it

              the questions about the ELIZA effect: If we are surrounded by

              for their advice? Or do we feel that these systems may intervene

              In my experience of tracking various processes in my body with IOS
              apps I noticed that I have an irrational fear that the application
              will start evaluating me. For example, my headache tracker app. I
              installed it to have more accurate information on the amount of
              migraines I experience in a month so that my doctor can find an
              optimal treatment for me. I stopped using it after marking one
              week of daily headaches, because it felt uncomfortable. I had a
              feeling that after knowing this, the app may start criticizing my
              lifestyle.

                I think by this time I can handle criticism from an app. What

                possibly analyze it and give their conclusions to interested
                third parties. There is a great irony in producing so many
                products for mental health and wellbeing in a world where mental

              Some apps are very direct — an app which reminds you to drink
              enough water will keep buzzing until you give it the number of
              glasses you drank. Some apps give you the freedom to choose what
              to track and what to keep to yourself. For example, the period
              tracker app automatically counts menstrual cycles but also has an
              additional menu with checkboxes for pills, sex, weight and
              temperature. There are also separate menus for moods, cramps, etc.
              Once I told a friend about the mixed feelings I have about using
              all these checkboxes and he joked that with this kind of interface
              this app can start a sex-coaching career. We laughed about it and
              continued talking about our human problems.

                  they'd like. The only legitimized way to install apps was via
                  the App Store, and Apple set a policy of curating apps that
                  would and wouldn't be allowed in. Some of the rules were

                  platforms, including apps that allow tethering your computer

              Also, the statistics from American App Store users show that the

              impressive number of downloads, what kind of image does this draw?
            </p>

            <p>
              Apps are an important and "inevitable” part of our digital
              environment; we download the ones we want to use and stick to
              them, because of convenience and trust. They are so integrated in
              our lives that we create apps to block, or limit ourselves from
              using other apps. We simply cannot quit. So we create a layer of
              apps and plugins which function as an on/off switches for the
              first layer. Also, the statistics show that the number of apps is
              increasing.

            <p>
              “There is an app for that” is an ironic response to a problem or
              request, and in the case of difficult decision-making, it can be
              rephrased in a question “Is there an app for that?”.

            <p>But what does trust mean in this particular case?</p>

            <p>
              When I discussed my interest in tracking data that my own body
              produces, one of my teachers asked me if I was talking about
              tracking myself or tracking other people. This is a very good
              question. Most likely, the apps I use are sending my data to a
              third party as I am writing this text.
            </p>

            <div class="oa_commit note">Commit:<span>2018</span></div>
            <div class="oa_commit_entry">
              <p>They are.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
              Imagine two realities: One where everyone tracks her data for her
              own good — or the most malicious use by third party is targeting
              her as a subject for advertising or scam attempts — and another
              where someone else tracks my body data without informing me about
              the purpose, and repurposes the app without my permission. The app
              which tracks the daily amount of water I drink won’t add poison in
              it, but if it’s a wearable device what if it could harm me?
            </p>

            <p>
              In another talk, the trust issue was also brought up — there’s no
              certainty if the app I’m using is doing what I think it does.
              Thinking in speculative scenarios and conspiracy theories, where
              data theft is merged with an actual theft, it is easy to imagine
              that someone replaces the iMessage app with another one with the
              same layout. While the user thinks she is sending pictures of
              clothes she bought on sale to her friends someone is actually
              targeting the user. This Bond-style scenario is gone too far for
              an average smartphone user, but at the same time there is no one
              hundred percent certainty that an activity tracker is nothing else
              but an activity tracker. If the device is sending direct feedback
              to a user’s body, it can possibly become a murder weapon.

                I think it is safe to say that technologies used in warfare and

              The process of leading to a desirable decision by hacking one’s
              behaviour is called nudging. This method is widely used in
              interface design — by looking closely it is easy to understand
              what kind of action the interface expects us to perform. For
              example, Facebook needs likes and comments to promote and score
              content. So the first feature under each post is a like button,
              and then comment and share. By sharing and commenting you put the
              post up in ranking. These buttons are located at such a position
              that they are noticeable and easy to press. If they were situated
              in a separate menu, likes wouldn’t have become the force moving
              Facebook. Unlike Facebook, Instagram doesn’t have the re-share
              button, and comments seem to be less important, while in Facebook
              the posts your friends have commented on would automatically be
              included in your feed (that’s why the interface automatically puts
              a user’s profile picture to an empty comment line, suggesting to
              “write a comment”).

                Facebook bought Instagram in 2012, and in 2017 Instagram
                Introduced structuring comments into threads and added the
                option to “like” comments. Also, after Snapchat refused to be
                bought by Facebook in 2013, both Instagram and Facebook
                introduced “stories” in 2016 and in 2017 respectively. Adding
                Snapchat-like disappearing content is meant to prevent users
                from downloading Snapchat. To cut it short, everything is
                becoming like Facebook, or, everything is becoming Facebook.

              Nudging is not only used as an element of interface design. The
              strategy is applied far more globally and in a variety of fields
              and situations. Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein listed numerous
              cases of nudging in their book
              <i
                >Nudge: Improving Decisions about Wealth, Health and
                Happiness</i
              >. One of the positive examples of nudging, according to the book,
              is placing healthy foods on a child’s eye level in a school
              canteen. Presented with the choice of healthy foods, kids select
              an apple instead of a candy bar. Starting with this example Thaler
              and Sunstein advocate nudging as a strategy of public and societal
              planning. Another example is encouraging people to donate organs
              after they die by simply making “donation” a default option. More
              people are becoming donors when they have to check the checkbox in
              case they don’t want to donate. As numerous studies found (also
              mentioned in the book), we tend to go with the default option,
              even if it’s not the best one. We succumb to inertia. So if
              donating is the default option, people will go for it. Donation is
              a positive example, but what if the default option is
              life-threatening? Not all the governments value the life of a
              single citizen.<sup>34</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              Thaler and Sunstein envision a society where governments and
              corporations are all interested in the benefits of their citizens
              and customers. I doubt this optimistic approach (not because I
              think corporations and governments are all totally evil). There is
              no way back from post-industrial societies, internet,
              smartphones,social networks, and what we call civilization in
              2016. As an app aficionada, I don’t see the necessity to quit our
              tools. My concern is the efficient symbiosis of a human and a
              device: At the current stage we are still excited (the World Wide
              Web itself is younger than 30 years old, and the first-ever apps
              were published in the App Store in 2008, which is only 8 years
              ago) and assign human functions and qualities to our digital
              companions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Personally I am interested in educating myself to use the present
              day technology wisely: to trust the tasks where it exceeds me and
              to let it empower my human qualities, instead of trying to fit to
              the machine way of thinking.I doubt nudging: How can you see any
              hidden strategy as a positive change? Nudging is powered by
              agreements: I want to run more, so I download an app which
              encourages me in a non-patronising way, we become friends. The
              software company gives insights about my running routine to a
              third party, possibly feeding it back to the app. I already trust
              the app, so there is no critical reflection on its behavior.
              Someone wants me to incorporate their product in my running, and
              the app is there to help.
            </p>

            <p>
              To take the school canteen example: what if candy bar
              manufacturers have their own goals (and as every business they
              certainly do want to increase their sales), so they nudge the
              director: While apples are still presented at the child's eye
              level the candy bar manufacturer sponsors the soccer game and
              award the winning team with sweet treats. Maybe it is my
              background, which makes me mistrustful. As a person born in the
              former USSR and current Russian Federation's capital, I am taught
              not to trust institutions. Learning from history and the example
              of a government acquiring the character of a regime makes me
              question nudging on any level.
            </p>

            <p>
              If not taking extreme examples such as an issue of freedom of
              choice under the regime, freedom of choice is still questionable
              on a basic level: every choice we make has a history of its
              creation. Thaler and Sunstein use the term “choice architect”. The
              person who places food in the canteen is our choice architect when
              it comes to choosing food. But so are our parents and friends, the
              neighborhood and the country, our mood and our news feed. We are
              not able to trace our choices to the initial trigger. And the ease
              of communication we acquire via our devices does not help to slow
              the pace and consider what is happening. Being constantly online
              and connected encourages people to favor fast decisions instead of
              contemplating a choice. How often we regret pressing the “send”
              button too early!

              There are programs and applications, employed as personal
              assistants. Personal assistants are not something everyone can
              afford, but in the culture of high achievers people are so busy
              that it is necessary to have one. Resolving issues and managing
              routines with ease has become a requirement and created a whole
              new level of complex workflows. It takes time and effort to manage
              and plan, and these tasks are taken seriously.

            <p>
              The popularity of random generators comes as a counter-argument in
              this technological craziness. There are elements of interface
              design, entirely dedicated to creating serendipity — the famous
              “Shuffle” function is an example, or an option to read a random
              article on Wikipedia. In the environment which is so well
              customised for user’s needs, the elements of randomness are gone:
              no more zapping tv channels, no more radio stations, or playing
              all these songs you would never expect to hear.

              Tools which are meant to structure and organize the process of
              choosing are becoming obstructions: it is harder to make a choice
              while being presented with so many options and possibilities to
              calculate the result. Making a solemn decision becomes a burden.
              The increasing notion of responsibility is frustrating.

              People are tricked by the idea that the knowledge of a problem
              that a human mind cannot seize in one go can be compressed. A
              famous painting by Magritte states that it is not a smoking pipe.
              It is a painting. The canvas and layers of paint on it have
              nothing to do with smoking. A map of the world is nothing but a
              piece of paper with colors and lines and letters on it. But when
              we look at the map, we see continents and oceans.
            </p>

            <p>
              We draw and imagine an ocean while filling in our agendas,
              planning our lives. Digital technology allows us to scale, and to
              drag and drop things in our oceans. One of the features of using
              applications for managing tasks and helping with choices is that
              the element of a game is introduced in the routine. Instead of
              thinking of the final goal the interface presents you the score.
              Information which would be difficult to digest otherwise is
              presented conveniently.

              In her lecture
              <i>Great design is serious, not solemn</i>
              Paula Scher talks about the different levels of concentration.
              Being solemn, in her words, is completing a task with the idea of
              its importance in mind. It is like being an adult. But being
              absolutely serious is being immersed in the process as a child,
              immersed in a game.<sup>38</sup>

                As a designer, I would be so so happy to follow Paula’s speech

              Great design, she says, is achieved by being serious, and on a
              larger scale that means that we achieve our best results when we
              forget that we are playing the game, but adopt the game as a
              current state of living.

              Designed to simplify our life, productivity and lifelogging tools
              also confuse the process of choosing and increase the amount of
              decisions we make without thinking. These systems execute a
              variety of tasks, following the concept of making users everyday
              life easy. A variety of tools keeps their user hydrated and fit,
              but also make them buy in one click and sign licence agreements
              without reading. As complex interfaces have moved to intuitive
              navigation and user-friendly experiences, the habit of thinking
              about the final purpose of navigation through a menu or choosing
              an option has become less important. Would lifelogging tools have
              been so widely popular if a user would have to open five menus in

                And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack

              In the end of this research I found myself in a strange position:
              looking forward to further developments in the field of AI and
              finding myself skeptical about my own enthusiasm at the same time.
            </p>

            <p>
              Researching the milestones in the development of AI taught me that
              since the 1960’s AI has been trained to have conversations with a
              human, and to compete in games. Comparing the approach of
              biohackers with Donna Haraway’s cyborg manifesto allows us to
              understand the origins of data-driven lifestyle: It comes from
              technology enthusiasts on one side, and the values of capital and
              the need to compete on a job market on the other side. The desire
              to compete fuels the productivity race, and the fear of AI as our
              competitor makes people feel helpless.
            </p>

            <p>
              The rising popularity of wearables and activity trackers increases
              the feeling that a human body “as is” is insufficient. These tools
              contribute to the feeling of insecurity not only by their presence
              in our lives, but also by the ways they operate: Lifelogging
              craziness can be seen as a never ending cycle — users track their
              health data in order to not get sick, because they need to stay
              healthy to be productive so they can work to afford this
              technology which helps them not to get sick...The culture of high
              achievers has no place for insecurity.

              Interfaces of messenger apps make conversation with a human and
              conversation with a chatbot look alike. The need for constant
              interaction is partly created and partly managed by software —
              people talk to each other via applications, which are shaping the
              conversation in such a way that it is not that important whether
              there is anyone on the other side of the screen.

                Yet, all the remote meetings on Skype are all held via video
                call. That proves that me and people in my professional filter
                bubble are still very much in need of recognizing ourselves as
                embodied individuals. What if our common realisation of
                embodiment is what makes Skype meetings efficient?

              It could also be an AI. When real friends have their own lives to
              live, an invisible boyfriend is always online.

              Fascination with technology and belief in its superiority is
              promising security, comfort, and ease. Trying to adopt the
              directness of a computer, like executing a script, we try to avoid
              doubting and feeling lost, which is an important part of creative
              process.
            </p>

            <p>These tools present us with the overpowering idea of ease.</p>

              What does becoming one with a machine really mean? What stirs our
              curiosity and challenges us if everything is optimized? Is it
              because a human wants to become a machine, or because she wants to
              dissociate with her animal and organic origin?
            </p>

            <p>
              Wealthy people of the first world, we consider ourselves advanced,
              but, sadly, owning expensive and smart devices does not stop us
              from feeling pain.
            </p>

            <p>
              Technology defines what it means to be a human: is the human the
              one who doubts? The one who feels pain? The one who makes
              machines? We, humans, are all of that.

                Two years ago, this text was supposed to end with a conclusion.
                Conclusion was meant to finalise the thesis so it could be
                submitted, graded, evaluated and left by its author – I had to
                move to the next project, severing the parts. This is not how
                writing works and this isn’t how I work either. Texts aren’t
                used to make work. There is a secret/separate life of text, when
                once written it starts the job, making you who you are, often
                with resistance. While working for you it enslaves you.
              </p>

              <p>
                Some parts of this text are very naive, some are outdated. What
                I find interesting about texts living lives of their own is that
                they become demanding: to keep up, they need new insights, new
                observations, new references. They need new readers and new
                questions. Once the demands are satisfied, the cycle repeats. As
                a conclusion, I say that I prefer observations, notes and
                comments over conclusions anytime.

                In 1982 Ridley Scott’s masterpiece “Blade Runner”
                <sup>4</sup>
                depicts a world where humans coexist with androids, manufactured
                by the powerful Tyrell corporation. The corporation's motto,
                “More human than human”, is a dream-come-true AI challenge:
                competing with a human player is an ultimate training playground
                for the development of artificial intelligence.
              </p>

              <p>
                In 1997, a computer called Deep Blue defeated the reigning chess
                champion. In less than 20 years the next milestone in AI
                development was reached: in October 2015, Google’s AlphaGo
                defeated the reigning three-time European Go champion Fan Hui.

                The difference between Deep Blue and AlphaGo is that the latter
                taught itself. Calculating the most efficient combination, as in
                chess, would not have been possible, since in the game of Go
                there are
                1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

                In 2016, Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google’s Deep Mind,
                published an article, explaining the process to a general
                audience:
                <span class="quote">
                  We built a system, AlphaGo, that combines an advanced tree
                  search with deep neural networks. These neural networks take a
                  description of the Go board as an input and process it through
                  12 different network layers containing millions of neuron-like
                  connections. One neural network, the “policy network,” selects
                  the next move to play. The other neural network, the “value
                  network,” predicts the winner of the game. We trained the
                  neural networks on 30 million moves from games played by human
                  experts, until it could predict the human move 57 percent of
                  the time (the previous record before AlphaGo was 44 percent).
                  But our goal is to beat the best human players, not just mimic
                  them. To do this, AlphaGo learned to discover new strategies
                  for itself, by playing thousands of games between its neural
                  networks, and adjusting the connections using a
                  trial-and-error process known as reinforcement learning. Of
                  course, all of this requires a huge amount of computing power,
                  so we made extensive use of Google Cloud Platform.”
                </span>
              </p>

              <p>
                The way in which Hassabis formulates the goals AlphaGo is about
                to achieve can perfectly explain how AI can acquire a passion
                for competing. In his words, the goal is to “beat the best human
                players, not just mimic them”. To process this information as a
                non-scientist, I allow myself to generalize and conclude that
                Google is building an enormous artificial brain and teaching it
                to win at games, using games as a playground to train the
                superintelligence until it will be applied to solving “important
                real-world problems”.

                In 1938, in Homo Ludens: a study of the play-element in culture,
                Johan Huizinga writes that as a game can be seen as a
                battlefield, the battlefield can also be seen as a game.
                According to Huizinga, playing games is fundamental for humanity
                and vital for animals: While human kids play with dolls and fake
                guns, kittens attack their toys and chase each other. Once a
                human grows old and becomes serious, activities which have no
                practical purpose become luxury.

                  So as a go player myself, I'm surprised you don't mention the
                  significance of go as the oldest continuously played game in
                  the world. I've heard that some people speculate that if
                  there's intelligent life elsewhere in the universe they
                  probably play something like go. Some discussion of go's
                  history might enhance your point that it could be seen as
                  foundational to the development of intelligence.

                  Thank you for the comment! As a non-player, I did not look
                  into the value of go game while writing, but this is

                If our games carry our culture, will the AI obtain human values
                in the process of learning to play games?
              </p>

              <p>
                I generalize again, but on purpose, because I like the idea of
                an AI trained to see “human values” as valuing victory over
                participation. It gives an accurate, and at the same time
                totally wrong impression: If playing games wasn’t “fun” (another
                abstract idea AI will probably learn), there would be no games
                at all. At the same time, the culture of high-achievers, to
                which I hope to belong, values victory more than anything else.

                In the 1964 book Understanding Media, Marshall McLuhan wrote
                that all tools of communication are an extension of our body
                <sup>7</sup>
                . Counting all the technological development since the sixties,
                when the book was written, it is logical to think of a next step
                not as a further extension, but as a shift.

                If the physical body is not a necessity anymore, what kind of
                functionality will define a human being and how we will make our
                intelligence stand out?

                We are Homo sapiens, “the wise men”, the people who know.
                Knowledge is subjective. On the other hand, the technology we
                have created with our wisdom, provides us with the objective
                information we are missing. With the idea of competition in
                mind, when the human is compared to a machine, the understanding
                of the strong points of humans as a species is not as strong as
                the understanding of their weak points. In the current intuitive
                and responsive digital workflow, computers trick humans into
                believing they are the same, and humans try to pick up the pace
                and to “adapt for the machinery”

                The attempt to imagine the future network of organic and
                non-organic intelligences is not just a speculation. It is a
                tool, a filter, which helps to reflect on the ways in which
                people interact with their devices

                at the present moment. With “body as an obstruction” as my
                starting point, I aim to uncover what contributes to this
                feeling of insecurity and why exactly the perspective of the
                rise of superintelligent AI makes embodiment feel like a
                disability. Are there any benefits of being a human within the
                physical body from the perspective of coexistence with
                superintelligent machines?

                Online platforms such as Pinterest already give us advice on
                what to wear, what to cook, how to decorate our houses and many
                other topics. An example of embedding the non-curated selection
                in daily life is following trending topics on such online
                archives. Pinterest is a collection of boards where users “pin”
                contents from all over the web, creating a huge web archive.
              </p>

              <p>
                One day a BuzzFeed journalist, named Rachel Wilkerson Miller,
                decided to live a week of her life, according to the “most
                popular” page on Pinterest. She wrote:
              </p>

              <p>
                <span class="quote">
                  “Since its launch in 2010, Pinterest has earned a reputation
                  as a site for Mormon housewives, mommy bloggers, and basic
                  white girls. I am a woman of color with a full-time job, I
                  spend less than 30 minutes getting ready in the morning, and I
                  still like Pinterest. Characterizations of the site as a “a
                  churning cycle of interest, hope, inspiration, jealousy,
                  desperation, despair and depression” always irked me because I
                  think Pinterest is a useful bookmarking tool. The site had
                  never made me feel bad about myself. Then I discovered
                  Pinterest’s “most popular” page, which is essentially a
                  collage of white girls with impossibly great hair, superhuman
                  nail art skills, and apparently enough free time to create a
                  tidy basket of “postpartum supplies” for “every bathroom” in
                  the house. Suddenly I could see where Pinterest got its
                  reputation.”<sup>30</sup>
                </span>
              </p>

              <p>
                Designed as a bookmarking tool, Pinterest creates an image
                moodboard for a user based on her own interests, but since the
                online realm doesn’t include failures and disappointments as in
                the offline routine, it presents you an image of yourself
                (reflected in in interests), but better. If looking for a less
                personalised result in favour of understanding trends based on
                the content on the entire platform, one can check the “popular”
                pins and boards. Fitting in the online trend, Wilkinson Miller
                discovered that trending advice looks completely alien to her.
              </p>

              <p>
                Until reading this article it never appeared to me that my
                personalized search does not give any idea of the main content
                of the resource. When I open the most popular pins collection on
                September 29, 2015, I saw a selection of DIY and handmade
                projects and felt like I’d just discovered a new online
                platform. My own feed consists of posters, vegan food, UX design
                and other things I find interesting. The world of face
                contouring and crocheted everything is as alien to me as to
                Wilkerson Miller, even though we are both Pinterest users. The
                Pinterest community feels non-curated and rather impersonal, but
                highly visually saturated — pinners form giant arrays of images,
                creating a collective (unconscious?) visual identity. Of course,
                trends emerge because many users like them, and that makes the
                sorting mechanism present them as popular. It is not the same as
                asking an app about what to do with your life.
              </p>

              <p>
                One of the successful tips that Wilkerson Miller took from
                Pinterest was making salads in a jar. Mason jar salads used to
                be a hipster food, and maybe still are, but I do wonder if the
                amount of re-pins of the recipes and tutorials tricked the
                stores into adding salad jars into their assortment, and if the
                people who buy salad jars learned about the trend from
                Pinterest.

                Previously I have mentioned ELIZA, a chat bot which simulated a
                human-human interaction. “The invisible boyfriend”
                <sup>35</sup>
                is an interesting example of further development in a concept of
                virtual presence. It is a human-to-human interaction which is
                curated by an interface. This service is created to satisfy the
                needs of people who, for various reasons, need to simulate being
                in a relationship. This service creates a realistic virtual
                presence and a detailed documentation of a non-existent
                relationship, so the client can make others believe that he or
                she is dating someone.
              </p>

              <p>
                The curious detail of this app is the fact that although the
                search is automated both the client and the person who works as
                the “invisible boyfriend” are real people. The article “With
                Bots Like These, Who Needs Friends?”
                <sup></sup>
                by Tim Moynihan of Wired explains the process and the history of
                creation of the Invisible Boyfriend:
              </p>

              <p>
                <span class="quote">
                  “The concept is simple: You pay to bae. The apps are run by
                  Matt Homann and Kyle Tabor, who cooked up the idea during a
                  hackathon in 2013. The service began as a chatbot simulation
                  wherein you would text a “boyfriend” or “girlfriend,” but now,
                  actual human beings are doing the talking. Tabor says more
                  than 70,000 fake girlfriends and fake boyfriends have been
                  created since the service launched in January, proving there
                  is an economy of loneliness.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The basics to the service (picking a name, a photo, an age,
                  etc) are free. If you want to take things any further, it’ll
                  cost you. For $25 per month, you get 100 text messages, 10
                  voicemails, and a handwritten note from your fake boo. $15 per
                  month gets you texts only.”
                </span>
              </p>

              <p>
                The initial idea of creating a chatbot didn’t create a
                convincing simulation, so the company hired real people through
                Crowdsource. According to the founders, currently there are over
                600 people writing for the company.
